    <br>A couple months ago, I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness is Baking. This cookbook include Maida Heatter's favorite recipes with 
    the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan.I, unsuprisingly, immediately feel in love with my newest cookbook. It's a collection of 100 
    foolprof and classic desserts including cookies, cakes, muffins, pies, tarts, and more that range from simple everyday cookies to
    outrageously indulgent chololate souffle cake.

<b>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b>
    <br><dd>Dark rum is best, but you an use brandy or your favorite coffe liqueur.</dd></b>

    <td>
       <b><br>Egg whites or whipped  cream?</b> 
       <br><dd> Most tiramisu recipes uses egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy 
        texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you're getting both delightful 
        textures.</dd>

    <td>

        <b><br>Are the eggs cooked?</b>
        <br><dd>Tiramisu is a non-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs
        because they are safe to consume raw.</dd>

<tr>

    <td>
        <b><br> What size pan to use?</b>
        <br><dd>   This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I reommend a
        9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too. </dd>
